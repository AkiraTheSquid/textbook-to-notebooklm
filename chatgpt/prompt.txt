Page 11: Introduction
Page 12: About the Step 3 Exam The USMLE® Step 3 exam is the last in a series of 3 USMLE examinations that all physicians applying for a license to practice medicine in the United States are required to pass. After successfully completing the 3 steps of the USMLE, a physician is eligible to practice medicine in an independent, unsupervised setting (some period of U.S. postgraduate training is also required). This test is not merely a more advanced and detailed version of the Step 2 CK or CS exams. Understanding this concept is key to this challenging exam. Step 3 tests whether a physician not only can assimilate data and diagnose clinical conditions but also has acquired the ability to make clinical decisions about patient management in a way that ensures appropriate management in an unsupervised setting. In addition, Step 3 will test your understanding of basic science correlations. How can the Step 3 test all first-year interns if they are working in such varied subspecialty settings? The same concepts that medicine house-officers learn about managing a diabetic patient with heart failure can be equally applied to a postsurgical patient with heart failure.
Page 13: How Is Step 3 Different? Unlike the Step 2 exams, which emphasize diagnosis of medical conditions, Step 3 tests your ability to evaluate the severity of a patient’s condition and discern the most appropriate clinical management based on the presenting scenario. This assessment of your clinical judgment distinguishes Step 3 from Step 2. In Step 3, you are required to think beyond the diagnosis (which is often implicit in the question itself) and make decisions in management. The cases presented will include options that may all appear appropriate; however, for the presented situation, there is only ever one correct answer. Your interpretation of laboratory data, imaging, and elements of the presenting history and physical examination will assist you in selecting the correct management.
Page 14: Clinical Encounter Frames Multiple-choice and case-simulation questions are presented in one of three clinical encounter frames: initial care, continuing care, and urgent care. The encounter frame determines the amount of history as well as clinical and laboratory test results that are available to you. More importantly, the encounter frame influences how you’ll proceed with management. For example, a longstanding patient with a history of repeated hospitalizations for asthma who presents with shortness of breath would be approached differently than if she were presenting for the first time to a clinic complaining of periodic dyspnea or if she presented to the emergency department with an acute asthma attack. The majority of test items (50–60%) in Step 3 involve the management of continuing-care patients. In the continuing-care setting, you are tested on your ability to recognize new problems in an existing condition, assess severity, establish prognosis, monitor therapy, and perform long-term management.
Page 15: Clinical Settings There are three clinical settings in Step 3: office/health center, inpatient facility, and emergency department. As with the encounter frame, knowing the clinical setting influences your management decisions. As will be discussed in the Examination Structure section, test questions will be arranged in blocks based on one of the three clinical settings.
Page 16: Physician Tasks For any given clinical encounter frame in a clinical setting, you’ll be challenged with a finite number of skills. The 6 physician tasks that are tested on the Step 3 exam are representative of what all physicians practicing unsupervised medical management are expected to know. Task Tests your ability to… Obtaining a history and performing a physical examination Using laboratory and diagnostic studies Formulating the most likely diagnosis Evaluating the severity of the patient’s problems Managing the patient Identify key facets of the history or physical exam and relate them to the presenting problem or condition Predict the most likely additional physical finding or examination technique that would result in the finding Select the appropriate routine or initial lab or diagnostic test either to ensure effective therapy or to establish diagnosis Predict the most likely lab or diagnostic test result Determine the diagnosis and use it to manage the patient Assess the severity of a patient’s condition and identify indications for consultations or further diagnostic workup Recognize factors in history, physical exam, or lab studies that affect prognosis or determine a ch...
Page 17: Applying scientific concepts Identify processes responsible for an underlying condition and interpret results of clinical or epidemiological experiments
Page 18: Step 3 Examination Structure The USMLE Step 3 is a 2-day computerized examination. The first day and a half tests your knowledge with a total of 412 traditional multiple-choice questions, which are arranged in blocks organized by one of the three clinical settings. Within a block, you may answer the items in any order, review responses, and change answers. However, after exiting a block, you can no longer review questions or change answers within that block. A link to view standard lab values, as well as access a calculator, is available at any time within the block of questions. Day 1 includes 232 multiple-choice items divided into six 60-minute blocks of 38–39 items. A total of 60 minutes is allowed for completing each block of questions. The first day of testing is approximately 7 hours. There are 45 minutes of break time and an optional 5-minute tutorial completes the 8-hour day. Extra break time can be gained by completing question blocks or the tutorial before the allocated time. Day 2 includes 180 items divided into six blocks of 30 questions. There are approximately 9 hours in the test session on the second day. You will have 45 minutes to complete each of these blocks. The...
Page 19: formats, such as those based on scientific abstracts, pharmaceutical advertisements, and basic science correlates. Day 2: Step 3 Advanced Clinical Medicine (ACM). Day 2 will focus on assessment of applying comprehensive knowledge of health and disease in the context of patient management. This test day will include multiple-choice questions and computer-based case simulations (CCS). SINGLE ITEMS These questions are the traditional multiple-choice format that you encountered in Step 1 and Step 2 CK. These items include a patient vignette followed by four or five response options. Other options may be partially correct, but there is only one best answer. MULTIPLE ITEM SETS A single patient-centered vignette may be associated with 2 or 3 consecutive questions that are linked to the initial patient vignette but test different points. Questions are designed to be answered independently of each other. You are required to select the one best answer for each question. As with single items, any of the options may be partially correct, but there is only one best answer. CASES A single-patient or family-centered vignette may ask 2 or 3 questions, each related to the initial opening vignette. ...
Page 20: Guide to the CCS The Primum computer-based case simulation (CCS) is a testing format that allows you to provide care for a simulated patient. You decide which information to obtain and how to treat and monitor the patient’s progress. The computer records each step you take in caring for the patient and scores your overall performance. In the CCS software, you will be required to choose additional elements of the presented history, as well as select the components of the physical examination you wish to perform. You have the flexibility to order any laboratory study, procedure, request, and consultants, and you can begin medications and other therapies. Any of the thousands of possible entries that you type on the “order sheet” are processed and verified by the “clerk,” and there is no limit to the number of entries into the order sheet. However, each order has a corresponding “virtual time” in which the test result may be available or procedure can be performed. Advancing the virtual time allows you to obtain results and submit the requested procedures. As virtual time passes, the patient’s condition changes based on the underlying problem and the sequence and priority of your inte...
Page 21: Each case can be divided into 3 parts: the case introduction, vital signs, and initial history (first 1–2 minutes); the management of the case (10–12 minutes maximum, often less); and the conclusion of the case (last 5 minutes). CASE INTRODUCTION SCREEN The first screen is called the case introduction and provides a one- or two-sentence description of the patient’s chief complaint, the patient’s location at presentation, and time of day. After reading this screen, click the OK button. VITAL SIGNS SCREEN These initial vital signs are the most important indicator of whether this condition is acute- emergent or chronic-stable. Review for any abnormalities before hitting the OK button. (courtesy usmle.org) INITIAL HISTORY SCREEN The initial history screen gives you a comprehensive description of the history of present illness, medical history, family history, social history, and review of systems. Read this section carefully, as key diagnostic information is given here. After reading the history of present illness, you should be able to establish a short differential diagnostic list. Make note of any key features in the past
Page 22: medical, family, and social history and review of systems that support or refute your differential diagnosis. At the end of the initial history, click the OK button; this will mark the end of the prompted section of the case. (courtesy usmle.org) CASE MANAGEMENT This section of the case is driven by your actions rather than prompts from the software. There are 4 buttons at the top of the screen, which you will use to manage the case. You will be able to access any of these buttons until the last 5 minutes, at which point you are automatically brought to the final stage. (courtesy usmle.org) The History/Physical button allows you to order a follow-up history, as well as either a comprehensive or system-focused physical exam.
Page 23: (courtesy usmle.org) The Write Orders/Review Chart button brings up a number of other chart options, including an order sheet, progress notes, vital signs, lab reports, imaging studies, other tests, and a treatment record. (courtesy usmle.org) The clock button allows you to manipulate the case time clock (virtual time). This is a completely separate from the real-time clock, found at the bottom right part of the screen throughout the case. In real test time, you have up to a maximum of 10 to 25 minutes to manage the case from beginning to end. But to get results or schedule a time to reevaluate the patient, you’ll need to move the case time clock ahead. You may move the clock ahead in any of the following ways: Move the clock ahead to a selected time so that you can get a specific result back. Move the clock automatically to when the first result comes back. Remember that you will still need to manage the case in the interim period before the next available result may come back. Indicate a specific time to reevaluate the patient. Ask the patient to call you if he is having any problems.
Page 24: At the end of the case, you must enter your diagnosis on the screen provided. When you click OK, the case closes, and you move on to the next case.
Page 25: Score Reporting The minimum passing score for Step 3 is 198. This corresponds to answering 60–70% of the items correctly. The USMLE does not report performance as a percentile; rather, you will be given a 3-digit score. On the reverse side of the score report will be a graph of your performance, indicating your relative strengths and weaknesses. You are the only one who will see this graph, i.e., it is not sent to any institutions or licensing bodies.

Page 27: PART 1 INTERNAL MEDICINE
Page 28: 1 Neurology Stroke and TIA A 67-year-old man with a history of hypertension and diabetes comes to the ED with a sudden onset of weakness in the right arm and leg over the last hour. On exam he is unable to lift the bottom half of the right side of his face. What is the best initial step? Answer: B. Before giving thrombolytics or any anticoagulation, you need to rule out hemorrhagic stroke, which is a contraindication to thrombolytics. You cannot even give aspirin without doing a head CT first. Thrombolytics are indicated within at least the first 3–4.5 hours of the onset of the symptoms of a stroke. Remember, 20% of strokes are hemorrhagic. You do not need contrast to visualize blood; contrast is used to detect cancer or infection, such as an abscess. Stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA) present with the sudden onset of weakness on one side of the body. Weakness of half of the face and aphasia are common as well. Partial or total loss of vision may be present, which may be transient. The cause is decreased or altered cerebral blood flow. Stroke is distinguished from TIA based on time. a. Head CT with contrast b. Head CT without contrast c. Aspirin d. Thrombolytics e. MRI With...
Page 29: With stroke, the younger the patient, the more likely it is that the cause is a vasculitis or hypercoagulable state. Cryptogenic stroke means there is no known etiology. It can be labeled “cryptogenic” only after: Arterial lesions are a subtype of stroke and TIA. On the Step 3 exam, you will likely be asked to identify or localize a lesion based on characteristic symptoms. Cerebral Artery Symptoms Anterior cerebral artery Middle cerebral artery Posterior cerebral artery With TIA, symptoms last <24 hours and resolve completely. The only symptom may be transient loss of vision in one eye (amaurosis fugax); the first branch of the internal carotid artery is the ophthalmic artery. TIA is always caused by emboli or thrombosis and never caused by hemorrhage (hemorrhage does not resolve in 24 hours). — Carotids: <70% stenosis Echo: no clots or vegetation Holter: no A-fib Implantable loop recorder (1–6 months): no A-fib Profound lower extremity weakness (contralateral in the case of unilateral arterial occlusion) Mild upper extremity weakness (contralateral in the case of unilateral arterial occlusion) Personality changes or psychiatric disturbance Urinary incontinence Profound upper extre...
Page 30: Vertebrobasilar artery Posterior inferior cerebellar artery Lacunar infarct Ophthalmic artery Diagnostic testing for both stroke and TIA is as follows: Add statins to all nonhemorrhagic strokes. Vertigo Nausea and vomiting more likely than with other strokes “Drop attack” (loss of consciousness) Vertical nystagmus Dysarthria Sensory changes in face and scalp Ataxia Bilateral findings Ipsilateral face Contralateral body Vertigo and Horner syndrome Absence of cortical deficits Ataxia Parkinsonian signs Sensory deficits Hemiparesis (most notable in the face) Possible bulbar signs Amaurosis fugax Head CT without contrast (best initial diagnostic test) Extremely sensitive for blood— Within first several days, all nonhemorrhagic strokes should be associated with a normal head CT — Need 3–5 days before CT can detect nonhemorrhagic stroke with >95% sensitivity— MRI achieves >95% sensitivity for a nonhemorrhagic stroke within 24 hours, but CT is done first: less expensive, more sensitive for blood MRA (most accurately images the brain for stroke) can be positive within 30–60 minutes of stroke
Page 31: tPA between 3–4.5 hours: Always do head CT without contrast before anticoagulating to exclude a hemorrhagic stroke. Treatment of stroke and TIA depends on time elapsed since the onset of symptoms and whether thrombolytics (tPA) can be used: Antiplatelet therapy is indicated in all those with stroke or TIA. (This includes pregnant patients: Pregnancy is not a contraindication to tPA.) Age <80 NIH stroke scale <25 Not diabetic with previous stroke Not on anticoagulation Within the past 3 hours: tPA 3–4.5 hours ago Thrombolytics (tPA) if stroke is not severe (NIH stroke scale >25) and the patient:— Is age <80 Does not have diabetes with history of stroke Does not use anticoagulation Absolute contraindications to tPA:— History of hemorrhagic stroke Presence of intracranial neoplasm/mass or a bleeding disorder Active bleeding or surgery within 6 weeks, cerebral trauma or brain surgery within 6 months, or nonhemorrhagic stroke within 1 year Suspicion of aortic dissection More than 4.5 hours ago or tPA cannot be given Remove clot with a catheter (useful up to 24 hours after stroke). This is not angioplasty. Angioplasty would rupture the vessel, whereas a catheter pulls the clot out like a...
Page 32: Catheter retrieval provides a definite benefit up to 24 hours after stroke onset. It decreases both focal neurological findings and mortality. Don’t forget to control hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia in stroke patients. Hypertensive urgency is a relative contraindication to thrombolytic therapy. Heparin has no evidence of benefit for stroke, and ticlopidine is always a wrong answer (no advantage over clopidogrel and has more adverse effects [TTP, neutropenia]). Do not use prasugrel for TIA/stroke. Prasugrel increases bleeding. When is closure of patent foramen ovale (PFO) the next step in management? After thrombolytic use: start antiplatelet therapy after 24 hours Small strokes (NIH stroke scale <6) or TIA: Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with aspirin and clopidogrel— Stop clopidogrel after several weeks and continue aspirin indefinitely; we do not continue aspirin and clopidogrel (DAPT) long term in a stroke because of increased risk of bleeding — Large strokes: Aspirin— If patient was already on aspirin: either add dipyridamole or switch aspirin to clopidogrel— Thrombolytic use 3–4.5 hours after the onset of stroke symptoms is useful in select patients. <20% of patien...
Page 33: PFO closure is conducted in conjunction with antiplatelet therapy and is done with a percutaneous device. CEREBRAL VENOUS THROMBOSIS In cerebral vein thrombosis (a type of stroke), clotting in cerebral veins presents with headache developing over several days (can mimic subarachnoid hemorrhage). Many patients present with the same weakness and speech difficulty seen in stroke. LP is normal. Oral contraceptives are contraindicated in cerebral venous thrombosis. Magnetic resonance venography (MRV) is the most accurate test. Treat with LMW heparin followed by a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) for a few months (e.g., edoxaban, apixaban, rivaroxaban, dabigatran). Further management includes: Use MRI/MRA for the brainstem. The following are indicated in all patients with stroke or TIA: Stroke: After the head CT and administration of thrombolytics or aspirin, move the clock forward on CCS. On subsequent screens, the most important issue is to determine the origin of the stroke. Paradoxical emboli through a patent foramen ovale (PFO) need closure with a catheter device.— PFO closure is also indicated if stroke/TIA is cryptogenic and there is left-to-right shunt.— Use DAPT (aspirin and clo...
Page 34: Anterior stroke and middle cerebral artery stroke are managed the same way. 24–48 hour Holter is not enough to exclude A-fib. Condition Goal Hypertension At least <140/90 mm Hg in a diabetic Diabetes Same glycemic control as general population: HgA1c <7% Hyperlipidemia LDL <70 mg/dL add statins for all nonhemorrhagic strokes endarterectomy if patient is asymptomatic EKG and a Holter monitor if EKG is normal: DOACs are indicated for all stroke/TIA with A-fib or A- flutter In young patients age <50 with no past medical history (diabetes, hypertension), do sedimentation rate, VDRL or RPR, ANA, double-stranded DNA, protein C, protein S, factor V Leiden mutation, antiphospholipid syndromes
Page 35: Seizures In seizure disorders, only the management of status epilepticus is clear. Status epilepticus therapy is as follows (all medications are intravenous): Levetirecetam, valproic acid, and phenobarbital are interchangeable in status epilepticus. Diagnostic tests include: Neurology consult should be ordered for all seizure patients. On the exam, you will be asked your reason for the consult in 10 words or less. Liver failure and renal failure can cause seizures, but potassium disorders cannot. CCS Tip: On CCS, consultants never say anything. CCS is testing your knowledge of when you are expected to need help. Benzodiazepines, such as lorazepam If seizure persists after moving the clock forward 10–20 minutes, add fosphenytoin If seizure persists after moving the clock forward another 10–20 minutes, add levetiracetam, valproic acid, or phenobarbital If seizure persists after moving the clock forward another 10–20 minutes, add general anesthesia (e.g., pentobarbital, thiopental, midazolam, propofol) Sodium, calcium, glucose, oxygen, creatinine, and magnesium levels Head CT (urgently); if negative, consider MRI later Urine toxicology screen Liver and renal function Electroencephalog...
Page 36: Treatment is as follows: Phenytoin decreases folate levels. Single seizure: Chronic antiepileptic drug therapy is generally not indicated, with some exceptions: strong family history of seizures, abnormal EEG, status epilepticus that required benzodiazepines to stop the seizure, or uncorrectable precipitating cause (e.g., brain tumor). Chronic seizures: No single agent is the best initial therapy. First-line: levetiracetam, valproic acid, carbamazepine, phenytoin (all equal in efficacy); carbamazepine is also effective but is associated with severe skin reactions, e.g., Stevens- Johnson (HLA B*1502 testing can predict Stevens-Johnson) — In pregnancy, most dangerous is valproic acid while safest is levetiracetam or lamotrigine OCPs/estrogen increase metabolism of lamotrigine to ineffective levels Second-line: gabapentin, phenobarbital, lacosamide, zonisamide— Ethosuximide: best for absence or petit mal seizures Carbamazepine: most often associated with hyponatremia
Page 37: Parkinson Disease Parkinson disease (PD) is predominantly a gait disorder. Symptoms include trembling/shaking with a slow, abnormal festinating gait. Orthostasis is often seen. Drugs that worsen PD include antiemetics that inhibit dopamine: Physical findings include: There are no specific diagnostic tests to confirm PD. Scanning the head excludes stroke. Adverse effects of anticholinergic agents: Metoclopramide Prochlorperazine Antipsychotics “Cogwheel” rigidity; everything is slow, bradykinesia Resting tremor (resolves when patient moves or reaches for something) Hypomimia (a masklike, underreactive face) Micrographia (small writing) Orthostasis Intact cognition and memory Memory loss Constipation Glaucoma Urine retention
Page 38: Treatment is as follows: If these medications cannot control the patient’s symptoms, then use: Shy-Drager syndrome is PD characterized by orthostatic hypotension. Add fludrocortisone or midodrine. Fludrocortisone is pure mineralocorticoid (aldosterone) and midodrine is an oral alpha 1 agonist raising blood pressure. Progressive supranuclear palsy can be misdiagnosed for PD; the patient can’t look up or down (vertical gaze palsy). When levodopa causes psychosis, add pimavanserin or quetiapine to control those symptoms. A man with severe parkinsonism is admitted for a hip fracture. On admission, the medicine reconciliation form is not recorded, and his multiple Parkinson medications are not continued in the hospital. Which of the following can happen? Mild disease Anticholinergic, e.g., benztropine or trihexyphenidyl if age <60–70— Amantadine if age >60–70 (has fewer side effects than anticholinergics so better for older patients) — Severe disease (unable to perform activities of daily living, e.g., cooking, shopping) Dopamine agonists (pramipexole, ropinirole, rotigotine [given by patch], apomorphine): fewer side effects but less efficacy — Levodopa/carbidopa: greater efficacy but “...
Page 39: Answer: C. It is an idiosyncrasy of parkinsonism and its medical therapy that the sudden withdrawal of medications can result in rhabdomyolysis. The reason for this is not known. PSYCHOSIS IN PARKINSON DISEASE In all PD, psychotic symptoms must be managed, as 40% of patients with severe PD develop psychosis from therapy. ESSENTIAL TREMOR Essential tremor is a tremor that is worse with action (or “intention”). This is a tremor not associated with another illness. There is no specific diagnostic test. Treatment is beta-blockers, specifically propranolol. In a CCS case, move the clock forward 1–2 weeks for a repeat meeting, choose “interval history,” and repeat the neurological exam. a. Seizure or stroke b. Arrhythmia/MI c. Fever/rhabdomyolysis d. Diarrhea or malabsorption Use pimavanserin (5HT inhibitor) to minimize psychotic symptoms. This antipsychotic medication does not worsen PD because its mechanism does not inhibit dopamine. Quetiapine has the fewest adverse effects after pimavanserin. If tremor is still there, add primidone (antiepileptic medication) If tremor still persists, switch to topiramate or gabapentin If multiple medical therapies fail and severe tremor interferes wi...
Page 40: Magnetic resonance–focused ultrasound to ablate the thalamus with local heat will help improve the tremor. —
Page 41: Multiple Sclerosis Multiple sclerosis (MS) presents with abnormalities in any part of the CNS; these improve only to have another defect develop several months to years later. Trigeminal neuralgia is a first presentation in 30% of MS patients. Diagnostic testing includes: Anti-CD20 drugs decrease the progression of MS. Treatment is as follows: Optic neuritis (most common) Motor and sensory problems Defects of the bladder (e.g., an atonic bladder) Fatigue, severe depression Hyperreflexia, spasticity MRI (best initial and most accurate diagnostic test) Allergic reactions to gadolinium (contrast agent used with MRI) are less frequent than they are with iodinated contrast material used with CT scan. — Those with renal insufficiency may have a systemic overreaction with increased collagen deposition in soft tissues (nephrogenic systemic fibrosis); hardened fibrotic nodules develop on the skin and (in severe cases) the heart, lung, and liver. There is no specific treatment. — CSF (lumbar tap); done only if MRI is nondiagnostic Shows presence of oligoclonal bands— Elevated protein and mild rise in lymphocytes are typical— CT scan of the head: not needed, less sensitive than MRI Visual- an...
Page 42: Tropical spastic paraparesis (caused by HTLV-1) is like MS of the legs only. Steroids (best initial therapy for acute exacerbation) and sometimes plasmapheresis Vitamin D and calcium for all cases Disease-modifying therapy: Ocrelizumab, ofatumumab (anti-CD20 drugs that are disease-modifying)— Beta interferon, glatiramer, mitoxantrone, natalizumab (but causes PML), daclizumab, fingolimod, or dimethyl fumarate — Alemtuzumab (anti-CD52 drug that inhibits lymphocytes and deters progression)— Amantadine for fatigue Dalfampridine to increase walking speed Baclofen or tizanidine for spasticity
Page 43: Neuromyelitis Optica This CNS disorder involves the eye and spinal cord but spares the brain. Diagnose with antibodies to aquaporin-4 Treat with steroids, then eculizumab or rituximab
Page 44: Dementia With dementia syndromes, all patients have memory loss. All patients with memory loss must receive: ALZHEIMER DISEASE (AD) AD presents with slowly progressive memory loss exclusively in older patients (age >65). There are no focal deficits such as motor or sensory problems, but patients do develop apathy and, after several years, imprecise speech. Exercise slows the progression of dementia. AD is a diagnosis of exclusion. The best diagnostic test is a head CT scan showing diffuse, symmetrical atrophy. Treatment is anticholinesterase medications (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine). Memantine provides only modest benefit. Combinations are not effective. Head CT B12 level Thyroid function testing (T4/TSH) RPR or VDRL Preventing falls in the elderly is essential, as a fall in that population is far more deadly than a myocardial infarction. Strength training and exercise are the only proven way to prevent falls. Nearly any form of exercise helps: walking, yoga, tai chi, dancing, and weight training. Screening for visual problems and removing tripping hazards in the home should be done as well.
Page 45: FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA (PICK DISEASE) Personality and behavior become abnormal first. Memory is lost afterward. Movement disorder is not present. Head CT or MRI shows focal atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes. Treatment is the same as for AD, but the response will be less. CREUTZFELDT-JAKOB DISEASE (CJD) CJD is caused by prions, transmissible protein particles. It manifests as rapidly progressive dementia and the presence of myoclonus. Patients are younger than those with AD. CJD is why dementia excludes a patient as an organ donor: risk of transmitting CJD. Diagnostic testing is as follows: There is no treatment for CJD. LEWY BODY DEMENTIA Lewy body dementia is PD plus dementia. It is associated with very vivid, detailed hallucinations. Treat both the AD and the PD. Remember, PD is primarily a gait disorder. Lewy body dementia = AD + PD + visual hallucinations EEG (abnormal) Brain biopsy (most accurate diagnostic test) In a CCS case, perform MRI as well, although there is nothing on MRI to suggest CJD CSF: the presence of the 14-3-3 protein spares the need for brain biopsy
Page 46: NORMAL PRESSURE HYDROCEPHALUS This condition generally presents in older males, but it can affect women as well. Symptoms can be remembered as WWW: wet, weird, wobbly. Diagnostic testing includes CT of the head. Lumbar puncture (LP) will show normal pressure, and this should be done on CCS. Treatment is placement of a shunt. Symptoms improve with CSF removal. HUNTINGTON DISEASE (HD)/CHOREA HD presents in a young patient (age 30s), far below the age for AD. On the exam you will likely be asked about family history. Symptoms are the following: Diagnose with specific genetic testing (autosomal dominant inheritance). MRI will show marked atrophy of the caudate nucleus. Treatment is antipsychotics for symptomatic control. What medications treat movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia and HD? Wet: urinary incontinence Weird: dementia Wobbly: wide-based gait/ataxia Dementia Psychiatric disturbance with personality changes Chorea/movement disorder Deutetrabenazine, tetrabenazine, and valbenazine, which alter levels of monoamines (e.g., dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine)
Page 47: Headache MIGRAINE Of migraines, 60% are unilateral and 40% are bilateral. Triggers include cheese, caffeine, menstruation, and OCPs. The following symptoms may precede the headache: Diagnostic testing is head CT or MRI when the headache has any of the following characteristics: Abortive therapy is as follows: Aura of bright flashing lights Scotomata Abnormal smells Sudden and/or severe Onset after age 40 Associated with focal neurological findings Triptans or ergotamine All triptans are interchangeable for aborting acute migraine: sumatriptan, almotriptan, eletriptan, naratriptan, zolmitriptan — Calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists: rimegepant, ubrogepant CGRP drugs do not cause vasospasm; safe in CAD and hypertension— 5HT agonists: lasmiditan 5HT agonists do not cause vasoconstriction— If status migrainosus or cannot give triptans/ergotamine: dopamine antagonists (prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine) All can prolong QT— All can worsen Parkinson disease— Use with diphenhydramine to prevent dystonic reaction— Transcranial magnetic stimulation may be needed for acute migraine if other treatments do not
Page 48: Preventive therapy requires several weeks to take effect: Dopamine antagonist antiemetics treat status migrainosus not responsive to triptans. Which migraine drug makes Parkinson disease worse? Answer: D. All worsen Parkinson disease symptoms because all are antidopaminergic. BASIC SCIENCE CORRELATE MECHANISM OF TRIPTANS Migraine is thought to be vasoconstriction followed by vasodilation, then pain. Triptans constrict vessels; they function by reconstricting the cerebral vessels, but they constrict vessels in the heart as well and can provoke cardiac ischemia. That is why they are dangerous in hypertension, pregnancy, and coronary disease. CLUSTER HEADACHE work When ≥4 headaches per month, give prophylactic therapy with beta-blockers (propranolol) CGRPs: erenumab, fremenezumab, galcanezumab, eptinezumab Alternate prophylactic medications are CCBs, tricyclic antidepressants, or AEDs such as topiramate or valproic acid a. Prochlorperazine b. Metoclopramide c. Chlorpromazine d. All of the above
Page 49: Cluster headache is exclusively unilateral with redness and tearing of the eye and rhinorrhea. Headache occurs multiple times in a short period and then resolves. Men > women 10:1. Abortive therapy is as follows: Preventive therapy is as follows: Verapamil increases prolactin and causes galactorrhea. “Cluster” is often over by the time prophylactic therapy has taken effect. Headache Type Migraine Cluster Gender More common in women More common in men Presentation Abortive therapy Prophylactic therapy TEMPORAL (OR GIANT CELL) ARTERITIS Triptans or ergotamine/caffeine 100% oxygen if cannot give triptans CCBs such as verapamil (best initial prophylactic therapy) Steroids, lithium, topiramate Unilateral or bilateral Aura Only unilateral Tearing and redness of eye; rhinorrhea No aura Triptans CGRP antagonists Lasmitidan Triptans 100% oxygen Propranolol CGRP antagonists Verapamil Lithium Steroids
Page 50: Temporal arteritis presents with jaw claudication and tenderness of the temporal area. Diagnostic testing includes erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and temporal artery biopsy (most accurate diagnostic test). Give steroids first and fast if these are available. A delay may result in permanent vision loss. Use tocilizumab (IL-6 antagonist) to reduce the use of steroids. PSEUDOTUMOR CEREBRI Look for an obese young woman with headache and double vision. On exam there is papilledema but normal CT/MRI. Vitamin A use is suggestive. Pseudotumor = headache plus: LP with opening pressure measurement (most accurate diagnostic test) will show a markedly elevated pressure. LP does not increase risk of herniation in pseudotumor cerebri. Treatment is weight loss and acetazolamide. Topiramate may help reduce weight and headache pain. If those fail, consider surgery for VP shunt and optic nerve sheath fenestration. INTRACRANIAL HYPOTENSION Treatment is blood patch to close off the leak. Sixth nerve palsy Visual field loss Transiently obscure vision Pulsatile tinnitus From CSF leak after LP Look for orthostatic headache MRI abnormal (80% of cases); confirm with low CSF pressure, <60 mm Hg
Page 51: Central Nervous System Infections When a CNS infection is suspected, perform a head CT before a lumbar puncture (LP) in the following circumstances: If these findings are present, get blood cultures and start empiric antibiotic therapy before ordering the head CT. BACTERIAL MENINGITIS A 45-year-old man comes to the ED with fever, headache, photophobia, and a stiff neck. What is the next best step in management? Answer: A. When you suspect bacterial meningitis, administer antibiotics quickly. Do blood cultures stat simultaneously with an LP, or immediately prior. Penicillin can never be used as empiric therapy for meningitis; it is not sufficiently broad in coverage to be an effective empiric therapy. In this case, there is no indication to do a CT. Vaccination for group B meningococcus is given at age 10–25. Focal neurologic deficit Presence of papilledema Seizures Altered consciousness a. LP b. Head CT scan c. Ceftriaxone and vancomycin d. Penicillin e. Move to ICU
Page 52: The most accurate diagnostic test is a culture, but you cannot wait for the results of the culture before starting therapy. Preliminary analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is useful. The Gram stain has poor sensitivity but good specificity for bacterial meningitis. CSF cell count is the most important criterion to determine the need to treat a patient. Thousands of polys (neutrophils) indicate bacterial meningitis until proven otherwise. CRYPTOCOCCUS The onset and duration of cryptococcal infection are much slower than in bacterial meningitis. It may not give severe meningeal signs, such as neck stiffness, photophobia, and high fever, all at the same time. Look for an HIV-positive patient with <100 CD4 cells. Gram stain is only 50–60% sensitive for bacterial meningitis, so a negative stain excludes nothing. On the other hand, a positive Gram stain is extremely useful and specific. Gram-positive diplococci: pneumococcus (most common bacterial cause)— Gram-negative diplococci: Neisseria— Gram-negative pleomorphic, coccobacillary organisms: Haemophilus— Gram-positive bacilli: Listeria— Elevated CSF protein is of marginal diagnostic benefit, as it is nonspecific (any form of CNS ...
Page 53: Treatment is amphotericin and 5-flucytosine (5FC), followed by oral fluconazole. LYME DISEASE Look for a patient who has recently returned from a camping or hiking trip. Tick exposure is remembered only by 20% of patients. Symptoms include joint pain, 7th cranial nerve palsy, and a rash with central clearing (target lesion). Note that 7th CN is not CNS. There are no characteristic CSF findings to confirm a diagnosis of CNS Lyme. Specific serologic or western blot testing on the CSF is the most accurate diagnostic test. Treatment is IV ceftriaxone or penicillin. ROCKY MOUNTAIN SPOTTED FEVER Look for a camper or hiker with a rash that starts on the wrists and ankles and moves centripetally toward the center. Fever, headache, and malaise precede the rash. Tick bite is remembered only by 60% of patients. Diagnose with specific serology. Doxycycline is the most effective therapy. TUBERCULOUS MENINGITIS Cryptococcal antigen (most accurate diagnostic test) If CD4 count does not rise, continue fluconazole indefinitely. If CD4 count rises >100, fluconazole can be stopped. Postpone the start of antiretroviral therapy for a few weeks to reduce the risk of immune reconstitution.
Page 54: It is very difficult to be precise about diagnosing TB meningitis. Look for an immigrant with a history of lung tuberculosis. The presentation is very slow, over weeks to months: If the case describes fever, headache, and neck stiffness over hours, it is not TB. Culture is the most accurate diagnostic test in TB of CSF but it will take weeks. PCR is the most accurate test you can get quickly. Head CT is normal in meningitis. Treatment is rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE) as you would give for pulmonary TB, but add steroids and extend the length of therapy longer. VIRAL MENINGITIS Viral meningitis is oftentimes a diagnosis of exclusion. There is a lymphocytic pleocytosis in the CSF. There is no specific treatment. An elderly man comes to the ED with fever, headache, a stiff neck, and photophobia. He is HIV- positive with <50 CD4 cells and a history of pneumocystis pneumonia. Head CT is normal. CSF shows 2,500 white cells that are all neutrophils; Gram stain is normal. What is the best initial therapy? Very high CSF protein level Positive acid fast (mycobacterial) stain of CSF (≤10% of cases); for acid-fast culture, you need 3 high-volume taps that are centrifu...
Page 55: Answer: C. Listeria monocytogenes is a cause of meningitis that is not adequately treated by any form of cephalosporin. Ampicillin is added to the usual regimen of ceftriaxone and vancomycin to cover Listeria. This cannot be fungal meningitis, because the CSF is characterized exclusively by a high number of neutrophils; neutrophils are not consistent with fungal meningitis. A 17-year-old boy comes to the ED with fever, headache, stiff neck, and photophobia. He has a petechial rash. CSF shows 2,499 neutrophils. Ceftriaxone and vancomycin are started. What is the next step in management? Answer: E. When an adolescent presents with a petechial rash and increased neutrophils on CSF, it is suggestive of Neisseria meningitidis. These patients should be placed on droplet isolation, and close contacts should receive prophylaxis. LISTERIA Look for elderly, neonatal, and HIV-positive patients and those who have no spleen, are on steroids, or are immunocompromised with leukemia or lymphoma. There will be elevated neutrophils in the CSF. Add ampicillin to treatment. a. Ceftriaxone and metronidazole b. Cefoxitin and mefloquine c. Ceftriaxone, ampicillin, and vancomycin d. Fluconazole e. Amphote...
Page 56: NEISSERIA MENINGITIS Look for patients who are adolescent, in the military, or asplenic or who have terminal complement deficiency. Treatment is as follows: The nurse or medical student taking care of a patient with Neisseria does not need prophylaxis. Those with kissing and other saliva-type contact do need prophylaxis. Prophylactic antibiotics are given regardless of the vaccination status of the exposed person in cases of serious exposure to Neisseria. AMOEBIC MENINGITIS Naegleria fowleri and Acanthamoeba are free-living, thermophilic (warm water) amoebae that can infect swimmers in fresh water. The amoebae swim up the nose and through the cribriform plate into the brain. Look for anosmia in the question stem. ENCEPHALITIS Patient: droplet isolation for 24 hours Close contacts (household members/those who kiss and share cups/utensils): prophylaxis with rifampin, ciprofloxacin, or ceftriaxone Routine contacts (school/work): no prophylaxis needed Without treatment, 95% of cases are fatal: emergency care required Wet mount of CSF shows mobile amoebae Treatment is miltefosine and maybe amphotericin; steroids may help
Page 57: Almost all encephalitis in the United States is caused by herpes simplex. The patient does not have to recall a herpes infection in the past for the condition to be herpes encephalitis. Varicella is a treatable form of encephalitis. Look for a patient with fever and altered mental status over a few hours. If the patient also has photophobia and a stiff neck, you will not be able to diagnose encephalitis. Fever + Confusion = Encephalitis Testing includes: “Brain biopsy” is the most common wrong answer on questions about encephalitis diagnosis. A brain biopsy is not necessary. Do a PCR instead. Varicella encephalitis is associated with stroke from vasculitis. Treatment is acyclovir for both HSV and VZV. With acyclovir-resistant patients, use foscarnet. BASIC SCIENCE CORRELATE MECHANISM OF ACYCLOVIR Acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir, and ganciclovir all have the same mechanism: to inhibit DNA polymerase. All need to be activated by thymidine kinase, except foscarnet. This is why ganciclovir cannot be used to treat acyclovir-resistant herpes and why foscarnet (with a different mechanism) is used instead. Head CT scan (best initial diagnostic test) PCR of the CSF for HSV and VZV (mos...
Page 58: Autoimmune (NMDA) Encephalitis BRAIN ABSCESS A brain abscess presents with fever, headache, and focal neurological deficits. CT scan reveals a “ring” (or contrast-enhancing) lesion. Contrast (“ring”) enhancement basically means infection or cancer. Brain Abscess Bacterial brain abscesses often spread from local infection (otitis, sinusitis, mastoiditis) into the brain. Get a biopsy to be certain what you are treating because bacterial brain abscess is often polymicrobial: Fever, headache, confusion, normal head CT like any encephalitis Psychiatric and behavioral symptoms (paranoia, delusions) and dystonias Ovarian teratomas in history Diagnose with specific antibodies in CSF Treatment is IVIG, steroids, and removal of the teratoma 30% Staph 30% gram-negatives 60% anaerobes 30% Strep
Page 59: Consider HIV status in the context of a brain abscess as follows: PROGRESSIVE MULTIFOCAL LEUKOENCEPHALOPATHY These brain lesions in HIV-positive patients are not associated with ring enhancement or mass effect. Look for HIV or alpha-integrin inhibitors (e.g., natalizumab) in the history. There is no specific treatment. Treat HIV and raise the CD4. When HIV is improved, the lesions will disappear. NEUROCYSTICERCOSIS Look for a patient from Mexico with a seizure. Head CT shows multiple 1-cm cystic lesions. Over time, the lesions calcify. Confirm diagnosis with serology. Treatment is albendazole and praziquantel when the lesions are still active and uncalcified (but not when there is only calcification; in those cases, use anti-epileptic drugs). Steroids are used to prevent a reaction to dying parasites. POSTERIOR REVERSIBLE ENCEPHALOPATHY SYNDROME This is an autoregulatory failure leading to cerebral ischemia. Look for headaches, altered consciousness, visual disturbance, and seizures in a setting of hypertensive crisis, preeclampsia, or cytotoxic medications such as cyclosporine. MRI shows vasogenic edema in posterior lobes. HIV-negative: brain biopsy (best next step); ceftriaxone, ...
